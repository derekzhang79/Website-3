<h2>cycomachead - michaelballphoto.com</h2>

<p>The change log mostly for personal interest right to keep track of the site progress over the years, but I figured I might as well make it available for anyone who is interested. I'll make sure each version will have the date I push the changes, and features will be followed by the date I added them to the list. Features with *** are the ones that I'm putting priority into working on either because they're easy or because it's something I really want to do or need to do (since IE testing doesn't count as desirable). However, features can happen in any order I want--It's my site! :-)
<br />

P.S. If you want to see something on the site, or notice something wrong, please send me a note and let me know!
