This was made waiting for the stop light to change standing on the corner before we ran down the pier to continue shooting. Despite the somewhat cliche nature of SoCal and Huntington Beach, there are plenty of cool opportunities as long as you&#8217;re careful in such large crowds!

The Pier 39 tree is pretty awesome to see and there&#8217;s great views of it from everywhere, including the bridge to a parking structure (though most people seemed to pass this view up, until I set down the tripod&#8230; )<br/><br/>

<p><img align="left" height="350" style="margin-right:10px; padding:.5em;" src="../images/14577982284_1.png" width="180"/></p>
<ul style="margin-left:1em;"><li>New Loading screen</li>
<li>Better/faster keyboard for entering numbers</li>
<li>Dismiss keyboard by tapping outside any field</li>
<li>A couple minor typos and bugs fixed</li>
</ul><p>Unfortunately, it is now 99¢ instead of free, but I did that out the the amount of time I have put into the program over the years, and as a college student, well… I need to fund myself some how. </p>
<p> Update: I&#8217;ve decided to move it back to free! :)</p>

<p>However, if you already have a current version, the update is free as it always will be! If not, do me a favor, and please head over to the <a href="http://itunes.com/apps/quadsolver" title="Quad Solver in the App Store" target="_blank">App Store </a>and check it out! Thanks!</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;ve gotten around to doing some cleanup I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a while. Mobile viewing will be much better now, and things shouldn&#8217;t overlap at all on small screens or low resolution displays. I&#8217;ve also made minor changes to various other parts of the site. If you would like to add a link to the Home Screen on your iPhone or iPad (or iPod touch too) I&#8217;ve now created a special icon for that.</p>
<p><em>…one more thing:</em></p>
<p>Comments! I&#8217;ve added comments. So, now I guess this is a real bona-fide blog (if there is such a thing). I&#8217;d love to hear what you think, and comments should make that much easier. So, please, say hello. :)</p></div>

<p>So, what&#8217;s happened? Lots! Though most of it was reading, projects, and other homework, naturally. It turns out the classes you expect to be easy aren&#8217;t, and the hard ones are still hard. (This is Cal, so I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised.)</p>

<p><strong>Computer Science @ Cal</strong></p>
<p>Cal is without a doubt one of the most amazing places to study computer science! I&#8217;ve lost count of the free meals, shirts, and other things from companies which really do want to give jobs and internships to students. It&#8217;s awesome, and no college student will ever turn dan free stuff. :)</p>
<p><img align="right" height="253" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7161/6542299575_dd2392fd00_o.png" width="400"/>I&#8217;ve also had the opportunity to work on a project to solve the game <a href="http://www.kenken.com" target="_blank">KenKen.</a> KenKen is similar to Sudoku, but instead of matching based on boxes, you have a cage which has a total value and a math operation to get to that value. It turns out, that in your first few months of a programming class, this is REALLY difficult. Some of this may have been more difficult because of our programming interface <a href="http://byob.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">BYOB</a>, but that&#8217;s a different issue. BYOB, by the way, is a pretty amazing way to do visual programming using &#8220;blocks&#8221; and dragging them in as you&#8217;d like to create really complex programs without getting bogged down in syntax. If you&#8217;re at all interested in programming, check it out! </p>
<p><strong>My Website – (like This page…)</strong></p>
<p>So, when solving KenKen got particularly crazy and difficult, I decided to finally get a new site up and running. It&#8217;s definitely no where near finished, but in the meantime, I hope you&#8217;re linking what I&#8217;ve done so far. Doing a photo a day is harder than it sounds, but it&#8217;s starting to pick up! :) As for the future, I promise I&#8217;ll post more, and comments should be coming soon!</p></div>
