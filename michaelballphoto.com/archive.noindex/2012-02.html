Wheeler Hall has a reputation on campus, especially within the last two years. Initially, everyone has mixed feeling because Wheeler Hall is home to UC Berkeley&#8217;s largest lecture hall where we&#8217;ve all spent plenty of time in both good and bad classes. However, recently, Wheeler has a sense of excitement around it. Since the UC financial crisis began in 2009, Wheeler Hall has been the place for many gatherngs, protests, and other (not so great) incidents. It&#8217;s one place on campus where there&#8217;s always something going on.<br/></p>

If you follow Hyde Street to North Beach you&#8217;ll end up at Hyde Street Pier which was once used a ferry dock among other things. Today, it&#8217;s home to a great collection of historic ships and other maritime artifacts, and great views!

The staircase at the Vatican Museum is pretty amazing from the top! It&#8217;s also pretty interesting when you look at it, the staircase is actually a double spiral design, so there&#8217;s really two sets of stairs in the same column.<br/></p>

So, today I went to a presentation at Berkeley which talked about Ansel Adams involvement with the UC and the collection of 6,700 which they are going to scan and share with students! I&#8217;m pretty darn excited, and since I was in a B&amp;W mood, I thought I&#8217;d try it for today&#8217;s shot!</p>

Doe Library is generally referred to as the main library on campus, though I&#8217;m pretty sure most people go to specialized libraries on campus or head to the Main Stacks if they actually need one of those antiquated things we call books. <br/>
However, Doe is an excellent place to study with its large reading rooms and has a very cool advantage: There&#8217;s a bust of Athena of the main entrance here, and according to a legend if you walk under Athena into the library she will bestow all her knowledge on you. BUT, if you walk back under her, she&#8217;ll take all that wisdowm back. :( Fortunately for those of us who like want to believe quirky school legends, there are many entrances and exits for which we try to beat the system! </p>

By now, it should be no secret that I love Hearst Mining Building at Berkeley! Built in 1902 this is one of the older buildings on campus which has a very cool stone look, and one of the few with real wood for decoration. It just has one of those &#8220;academic&#8221; feelings, like real learning is supposed to be going on there. <br/></p>

Well, it&#8217;s been a little while since I posted a shot! This is from the San Francisco Martime Park area looking towards the Golden Gate. It&#8217;s a pretty cool area because there&#8217;s lots of places to get both high and low, and Ghirardelli square isn&#8217;t too far away as well! :)</p>

This shopping center in Milan is one of the most interesting malls there probably is in the world. It&#8217;s shaped like a giant cross and in the center of the arcade are drawing on each side to represent the &#8216;four&#8217; contients. (You can see two of them).<br/></p>

Space is definitely a premium in Rome, and though the buildings are no where near the height of sky scrapers, looking up at the many obelisks gives a feeling of being closed in despite the semi-open spaces. This is the Solare or Obelisk of Montecitorio, located just past the Piazza de Spanga which is home to the famous Spanish Steps.  </p>

It&#8217;s a bit cold sometimes in the winter, but sitting by the Campinile is a good place to study! (Or, perhaps, check your phone in this moment.) It&#8217;s also really interesting to see how the scense changes here throughout the year.<br/></p>

2 Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, CA.<br/><br/>
Embarcadero Center has a very odd, yet very cool design as it spans 3 or 4 levels high over a period of about 4 small blocks stuck in the middle of the Finanical District. This is one of the many many curvey staircases which are scattered all across Embaradero Center.<br/></p>
