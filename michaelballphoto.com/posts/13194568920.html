I&amp;#8217;ve finally gotten a new site together. Actually, I think it speaks for itself at this point so there isn&amp;#8217;t too much to say. My previous site was OK, but hosting on my old laptop wasn&amp;#8217;t the greatest idea for reliability. So, welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s new? Well, I&amp;#8217;ve got a new layout, a better format, more links to everything. Oh and Tumblr. Yep, this a blog, but that&amp;#8217;s honestly not my main focus. I simply want to share what I&amp;#8217;m working on right now. So, please, check my links to the side, or &lt;a href="mailto:cycomachead@gmail.com" target="_blank"&gt;drop me a line&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. This site isn&amp;#8217;t quite finished, so do expect some changes for a while, or forever! If you&amp;#8217;re curious I&amp;#8217;m looking to add better features to share individual posts, maybe have a sticky post, and who knows what else. I&amp;#8217;ll always be adding to the &lt;a href="/photography" target="_self"&gt;Photography&lt;/a&gt; page too.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>site-info</tag><tag>welcome</tag><tag>news</tag><tag>cycomachead</tag><tag>Michael Ball</tag><tag>blog</tag></post>
