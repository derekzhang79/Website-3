Things do move pretty quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what&amp;#8217;s happened? Lots! Though most of it was reading, projects, and other homework, naturally. It turns out the classes you expect to be easy aren&amp;#8217;t, and the hard ones are still hard. (This is Cal, so I suppose I shouldn&amp;#8217;t be surprised.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer Science @ Cal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal is without a doubt one of the most amazing places to study computer science! I&amp;#8217;ve lost count of the free meals, shirts, and other things from companies which really do want to give jobs and internships to students. It&amp;#8217;s awesome, and no college student will ever turn dan free stuff. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right" height="253" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7161/6542299575_dd2392fd00_o.png" width="400"/&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also had the opportunity to work on a project to solve the game &lt;a href="http://www.kenken.com" target="_blank"&gt;KenKen.&lt;/a&gt; KenKen is similar to Sudoku, but instead of matching based on boxes, you have a cage which has a total value and a math operation to get to that value. It turns out, that in your first few months of a programming class, this is REALLY difficult. Some of this may have been more difficult because of our programming interface &lt;a href="http://byob.berkeley.edu" target="_blank"&gt;BYOB&lt;/a&gt;, but that&amp;#8217;s a different issue. BYOB, by the way, is a pretty amazing way to do visual programming using &amp;#8220;blocks&amp;#8221; and dragging them in as you&amp;#8217;d like to create really complex programs without getting bogged down in syntax. If you&amp;#8217;re at all interested in programming, check it out! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Website – (like This page…)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when solving KenKen got particularly crazy and difficult, I decided to finally get a new site up and running. It&amp;#8217;s definitely no where near finished, but in the meantime, I hope you&amp;#8217;re linking what I&amp;#8217;ve done so far. Doing a photo a day is harder than it sounds, but it&amp;#8217;s starting to pick up! :) As for the future, I promise I&amp;#8217;ll post more, and comments should be coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>cal</tag><tag>college</tag><tag>me</tag><tag>freshmen</tag><tag>Berkeley</tag><tag>UCB</tag><tag>computer science</tag><tag>computers</tag><tag>finals</tag><tag>KenKen</tag><tag>CS</tag><tag>BYOB</tag><tag>first semester</tag><tag>cycomachead</tag><tag>Michael Ball</tag></post>
