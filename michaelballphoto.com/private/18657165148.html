And given those reason, when does it not become a hobby?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the answer is relatively clear: Innovation. The AppleTV is very cool, and an excellent device (in my use) but it is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; innovative in the way that Apple&amp;#8217;s other devices are or in the direction it&amp;#8217;s going with it&amp;#8217;s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why isn&amp;#8217;t AppleTV innovative? Well, it&amp;#8217;s innovative, but only in small ways, and it most certainly isn&amp;#8217;t in comparison to the rest of the set top box / digital content devices market. Roku, Boxee, others all do much more than AppleTV does in terms of bring content to your television. They have an overall similar feature set (usually more than AppleTV), but aren&amp;#8217;t quite as polished in some ways.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>blog</tag></post>
